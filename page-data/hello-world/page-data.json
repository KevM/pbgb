I write software and compose videos of my son building Legos. This blog won’t likely be amazing to the external reader. This is a place for me to put down my thoughts and learnings for future me and maybe family if they want to suffer. If you, the outside reader, get a benefit from this. Great! But you are not my target audience so be kind.</p>\n<h2>What is with the “Y’all”?</h2>\n<p>My wife and I have been living in Austin Texas for 18 years. This makes me an official adult Texan so I feel obligated to use <em>y’all</em> as a way to address a diverse group. This is second nature to me now. I go back to my home state of Wisconsin and use y’all and it feels very normal. Yet, I do notice quizical looks searching for meaning when they hear my mid-west accent emit an sentence like “All y’all did a great job putting this conference together.”  </p>\n<h2>What the heck is this site / blog / thingy?</h2>\n<p>I’ve been keeping notes for years in different places containing my ramblings. This is yet another attempt to put them somewhere more central and discoverable in a more organized fashion. These longer more indulgant “ideas” belong somewhere that I have control. So I may from time to time pull in something I posted on Medium or Twitter and expand it here.</p>\n<h2>How are you doing this?</h2>\n<p>I am using GatsbyJS and a basic blog template. I discovered Gatsby a year ago and liked it but never had the time to use it for anything. Now that I am taking some time off between gigs. I do.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Howdy Y'all","date":"September 01, 2019","description":"Who, What, Where, Why?!"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/pinball-game-buttons/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Pinball Game Buttons"}}}}}
